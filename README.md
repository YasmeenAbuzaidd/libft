# Libft

## Description

Libft is a custom C library developed as part of the 42 curriculum.

The goal of this project is to recreate commonly used functions from the C standard library, while also implementing additional utility functions and linked-list operations.

Implementing these functions from scratch helps develop a strong understanding of C programming, memory management, pointers, strings, file descriptors, function pointers, structures, linked lists, Makefiles, static libraries, and compilation.

The final result is a reusable static library called `libft.a` that can be used in future C projects.

## Library Overview

The library is divided into three main parts:

- **Libc functions** — reimplementations of selected functions from the C standard library.
- **Additional functions** — string, memory, conversion, and file-descriptor utilities.
- **Linked-list functions** — functions for creating and manipulating singly linked lists.

All functions follow the 42 coding standards.

### 3. Linked List Functions

The project also includes a singly linked-list implementation:

```c
typedef struct s_list
{
    void            *content;
    struct s_list    *next;
}   t_list;
```

Each node contains a generic `void *` content pointer and a pointer to the next node.

| Function          | Description                                                        |

| `ft_lstmap`       | Creates a new list by applying a function to every node's content. |

## Instructions

### Compilation

The project uses a `Makefile` to compile the source files into the static library `libft.a`.

#### Compile

```bash
make
```

#### Remove object files

```bash
make clean
```

#### Remove object files and the library

```bash
make fclean
```

#### Recompile

```bash
make re
```

The Makefile uses:

```text
-Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

and creates the library using `ar`.

### Usage

Include the library header in your C project:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Compile your program with the library:

```bash
cc main.c -L. -lft -o program
```

Example:

```c
#include "libft.h"

int main(void)
{
    ft_putstr_fd("Hello from Libft!\n", 1);
    return (0);
}
```

Then run:

```bash
./program
```

## Technical Choices

### Dynamic Memory

Functions that create new strings or data structures use dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`. Allocated memory is released when it is no longer needed.

### Generic Data

The linked-list implementation uses `void *content`, allowing nodes to store different types of data.

### Function Pointers

Functions such as `ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`, `ft_lstiter`, and `ft_lstmap` use function pointers to apply custom behaviour to strings or list contents.

### Static Functions

Helper functions that are only needed inside a source file are declared as `static` to limit their scope.

### Defensive Programming

The functions handle relevant edge cases such as `NULL` pointers, empty strings, allocation failures, empty lists, and boundary conditions.

### AI Usage

AI was used as a learning and support tool during the project. It was used to clarify C programming concepts, help with debugging, explain functions and edge cases, and assist with organizing the README documentation.

The project code was written and tested by me.
